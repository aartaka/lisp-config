#+TITLE:My Lisp Configs

This is mainly a shared config for Lisp REPLs.

* Installation

Clone this repo as =~/.config/common-lisp=. This way the ASDF registry
conf ends up in the proper place too.

* Highlights
** Readline customizations
Some readline completions appended from =*-completions.txt=, so that
#+begin_src sh
  rlwrap ecl
#+end_src

Ends up with nice list of completions.

# TODO: Also include implementation-specific completions, like SI:*
# for ECL and SB-*:* for SBCL.

** Graven Image Customizations
Also has lots of =:around= methods for my [[https://github.com/aartaka/graven-image][Graven Image]]
standard-enhancing library. Mainly making printouts less overwhelming.

** Commands
Convenience commands to:
- :qq :: Quickly quit from the REPL in a portable fashion.
- :sh/:! :: Run shell command interactively/synchronously.
- :sha/:& :: Run shell command asynchronously.
- :loadsys/:lsd :: Load ASDF system.
- :quill/:ql :: Load system via Quicklisp.
- :dir :: Change the directory and print its contents.
- :page :: Page through the contents of the file or forms' output.

** Experimental editor
Command-based editor with
- :ed[it] :: as the entry point to edit file or shell command output.
- :ep[rint] :: to print the current line.
- :ez[oom] :: to scroll through the buffer.
- :ea[ppend] and :ei[nsert] :: to add new text.
- :ef[ind] :: for text search.
- :ek[ill] and :ey[ank] :: for clipboard management and text deletion.
- :es[ave] :: to save to file.

** Experimental "Talkative Lisp" Code
This feeds REPL output and input to EspeakNG to speak the text. The
plan is to turn it into a proper screenreader-ish setup.
