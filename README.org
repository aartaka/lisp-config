#+TITLE:My Lisp Configs

This is mainly a shared config for Lisp REPLs.

* Installation

Clone this repo as =~/.config/common-lisp=. This way the ASDF registry
conf ends up in the proper place too.

* Readline customizations

Some readline completions appended from =*-completions.txt=, so that
#+begin_src sh
  rlwrap ecl
#+end_src

Ends up with nice list of completions.

# TODO: Also include implementation-specific completions, like SI:*
# for ECL and SB-*:* for SBCL.

* Graven Image Customizations

Also has lots of =:around= methods for my [[https://github.com/aartaka/graven-image][Graven Image]]
standard-enhancing library. Mainly making printouts less overwhelming.
