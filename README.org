#+TITLE:My Lisp Configs

This is mainly a shared config propagating my setup to
implementation-specific config files. Some readline completions added
on top, so that e.g.
#+begin_src sh
  rlwrap ecl
#+end_src

Ends up with nice list of completions.

* Installation

Clone this repo as =~/.config/common-lisp=. This way the ASDF registry
conf ends up in the proper place too.

* Graven Image Customizations

Also has lots of =:around= methods for my [[https://github.com/aartaka/graven-image][Graven Image]]
standard-enhancing library. Mainly making printouts less overwhelming.
